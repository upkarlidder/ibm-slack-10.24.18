Why should you care?\n- What is Competition?\n- What is the source of Competition?\n- How can one analyze a given Strategy?\n- What makes for a good Strategy?\n- How can one construct a good Strategy?\n\nAfter 8 years of product and technology consulting, I've found that most start-ups and small businesses fail because they have a poor strategy. This session cuts through the hype and digs into what strategy is and isn't, leaving attendees with practical knowledge and processes that they can immediately apply to their careers, start-ups, and industries.\nDownload instructions to be prepared for this class\n\nDownload the speaker slides and material",

With the PasS offerings from public cloud platforms, DR has become a lot more cost effective and easy to implement. I will talk about key terms and metrics used for DR, and strategies which can be applicable to any type of infrastructure - on prem, on cloud, or hybrid.\n\nAfter this talk, you will become very familiar with Disaster Recovery fundamentals, and start thinking about options and strategies available based on your SLA while you architect your service. Terms like hot-cold, active-active will become much more relatable as well!\n\nI'll briefly refer to AWS and Data Center infrastructure during this talk - so basic familiarity with these will be helpful.",

We'll then describe the steps necessary to create projects & enable Google APIs from the Google Developers Console. Next we discuss how to create & access the needed credentials, then write code that talks to several Google APIs.While you can do the same thing using JavaScript, there is another developer tool that gives you access to Google APIs but in a slightly different way. The second half of the talk covers Google Apps Script, a self-contained JavaScript environment in the Google cloud. You'll learn what Apps Script is and how it's more like using \"services\" than traditional APIs. We'll show its dev environment and create a Google Sheets spreadsheet w/code that talks to several Google APIs.The applications you build, whether they use the Client Library or Apps Script, can be reached by any client, browser, desktop/laptop or mobile.

    "desc": "Learning how people (not machines) learn is not something we're taught in school, or what we were told is not backed by scientific evidence. Understanding how we learn, from a scientific point of view, helps us better communicate information to others so it will be understood and remembered.\n\nWe'll start with laying down an evidence-based foundation by looking at how we take in  and process information in working memory and, if we're lucky, gets stored in long-term memory. Like salmon returning to where they were born, getting the information into long-term memory is an upstream struggle, so we'll see ways to make that process easier by having images and words work together instead of fighting each other.\n\nWe'll then learn why forgetting is a good thing; mixing things up instead of cramming makes improves remembering; and attack some of the myths of learning. We'll find out there's the good way of making brains work hard during learning as well as bad ways, and see how learning is similar to isolating muscles when strength training.\n\nYou'll see examples along the way that will demonstrate applying this research and you'll come away with solid tips to confidently improve technical documentation, training manuals, video courses, and presentation slides.",

    "desc": "Agile is based on self-organizing teams, so if teams organize themselves, what do managers do?\n\nIt turns out that managers can play a critical role both in agile adoption and in agile success long-term.\n\nUnfortunately, scrum training mostly doesn\u2019t address the role: when trainers and coaches sketch the structure of a scrum team, they almost never include a manager. \n\nManagers not knowing their changed role can be a problem: A frequently cited barrier to agile adoption is managers who don't know what to do when their teams become self-managing. When they're not included in training, how would they (or anyone else, for that matter) know the contributions to which managers need to apply themselves. Worse, their larger organizations often lay down expectations for them that are incompatible with agile. \n\nAgile has shifted the old roles and responsibilities. A manager bent on command-and-control is clearly a barrier to agile adoption. But managers who take a hands-off approach or are unclear on the contribution they must make will almost certainly stymie adoption, as well.\n\nRon Lichty echoes many of the early agile thought leaders: managers have critical roles to play in enabling success, both in transitioning to agile and in agile itself. \nThis session is about managers\u2019 critical contributions, and is for managers, for prospective managers, for team leads, and for members of teams thinking through how to make their teams the best teams they\u2019ve ever been part of.",

We will learn requirements, configurations needed at each step. While GitHub for SCM, HSM for crypto  key generation  and Kubernetes  orchestration are core components, you will know how setup and configuration are different for each cloud.  Cloud specific info  needs to be stored in a common repository and reused over time. A new  JSON standard is proposed to store meta data of each cloud. For multi cloud deployment, the merged JSON document becomes  key to drive the  development and deployment of applications to each cloud. Thanks to repository driven services, developer is constantly made aware of  each cloud requirements and restrictions as development progresses. It is powerful tool to help developers develop and deploy applications securely across  the cloud. \n\nIn the end, you will take away  few best practices to deploy your application securely across  all cloud environments.",

This talk aims to help developers embrace security and identity as part of their tool chain and remove the skepticism around building their own API security. The developers should be able to use this discussion as a launchpad for building their own API authentication systems.

    "title": "Which Agile Framework Will Increase the ROI of My Company?",
    "desc": "Measuring the ROI of agile methods is one of the most important factors in figuring out what agile framework to adopt. Scope is variable in agile projects and so we are able to prioritize based on business value. As a result, it is very much possible to have a faster return on investment in agile projects compared to traditional projects. We can even increase the ROI more by adopting the right agile framework given a team's skillset (such as adopting the XP Agile Framework for the CI/CD practice).\n\nWe will explore several agile frameworks (such as Scrum, XP, Lean, FDD, etc.) and recommend which of these agile frameworks increases the ROI for specific types of Companies. We will look at different technologies including GitLab, OnBase, Jira, and Confluence.\n\nThis session is for current and prospective engineering directors/managers, technical program managers, and technical product managers. Managers that are involved with managing software engineers in software Companies are expected to benefit the most.",
